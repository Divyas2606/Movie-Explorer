## 🔥 **Troubleshooting**
### ❌ **No movies are showing?**
1. Open **Developer Console (`F12`)** → **Console Tab**.
2. Look for errors:
   - **"Failed to fetch"** → API might be blocked.
   - **"API Key Invalid"** → Check if the key is correct.

### ❌ **Movies showing broken images?**
- Some movies **don’t have posters**. You can use a placeholder image:
  ```js
  const poster = movie.Poster !== "N/A" ? movie.Poster : "https://via.placeholder.com/150";
  ```
